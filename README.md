ðŸŽ¨ Anushka Siwakoti-Portfolio
Hi! Iâ€™m Anushka â€” a freshly minted Computer Science grad who built this portfolio to blend code, creativity, and curiosity (and maybe fight off post-grad existential dread).

This site is a self-coded, self-styled celebration of everything Iâ€™ve worked on â€” from full-stack projects to paintings and photographs that keep me grounded.

Why I Built This
I wanted to:
Learn new tools and sharpen my front-end skills
Build something fully mine: from UX to deployment
Showcase my work in a way that feels authentic (and fun)
Keep my brain busy post-graduation

  Interactive Art + Photography gallery with smooth scroll and transitions

Art + Photos
When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m usually:
Making a mess with paint
Chasing light and color with my camera
